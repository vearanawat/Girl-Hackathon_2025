# Welcome to MediFlow

## Project Overview

**MediFlow** is an AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to automate **prescription processing, medical image analysis, and patient diagnosis**. It streamlines operations for **doctors, pharmacists, and patients**, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and security in medical workflows.

## Features

### **1️⃣ Patient Panel:**
- 🌡️ **AI Doctor Assistant**: Patients can input symptoms, and the system provides a preliminary diagnosis using the `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model.
- 📅 **Appointment Booking**: Patients can schedule appointments with doctors based on their conditions.
- 📦 **Order Tracking**: Patients can check the status of their prescriptions and orders.

### **2️⃣ Pharmacist Panel:**
- 📄 **Prescription Processing**: Pharmacists can upload handwritten or printed prescriptions.
- 🔍 **Text Extraction (OCR Models)**:
  - **PaddleOCR** (Higher accuracy for structured medical prescriptions).
  - **EasyOCR** (Supports multilingual prescriptions).
- 🏥 **Medical Term Recognition**: Extracted text is processed using a **BERT model** to prioritize medicines, dosages, and instructions.
- 🤖 **Order Generation (LLM)**: A **large language model (LLM)** generates structured orders based on the prescription and patient needs.
- 🎙 **Voice Prescription Support**: Converts **audio prescriptions to text**, processes it using **BERT → LLM pipeline**, and generates structured orders.

### **3️⃣ Doctor Panel:**
- 📷 **Medical Image Diagnosis**: Doctors can upload **X-ray and CT scan images**, and the system predicts diseases using:
  - 🩻 **X-ray Model**: `lambdalabs/Chest-X-ray-Classification`
  - 🧠 **CT Scan Model**: `UCSD-AI4H/chexnet`
- 📝 **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**: Doctors can input patient symptoms, and the system predicts potential diseases using the **BART model**.

## Security & Authentication
- 🔐 **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security.
- 🔄 **OAuth Integration** for secure and seamless logins.
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ensuring:
  - ✅ Patients can only view orders and book appointments.
  - ✅ Pharmacists can process prescriptions and generate orders.
  - ✅ Doctors can diagnose diseases and upload medical data.

HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=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
```
#### **Install dependencies and run the backend**
```sh
cd backend  # Navigate to backend folder
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
uvicorn combined_app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000  # Run the FastAPI backend
```

### **2️⃣ Frontend Setup**
#### **.env file (frontend folder)**
Create a `.env` file inside the **frontend** directory and add the following:
```sh
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_dGVuZGVyLXJhdHRsZXItNzUuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
```
#### **Install dependencies and run the frontend**
```sh
cd frontend  # Navigate to frontend folder
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run dev  # Start the frontend server
```
